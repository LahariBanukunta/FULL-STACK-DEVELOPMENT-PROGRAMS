        <h1>India Triumphs in T20 Cricket World Cup 2024</h1>
        <div class="author">By Lahari Banukunta</div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="text-first">
                <p id="first">The T20 Cricket World Cup, which concluded on June 29th, saw India crowned champions after
                    a thrilling final against South Africa. This victory marked the end of a long wait for India, who
                    last won the tournament in 2007.</p>
                <p>India’s performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, displaying remarkable composure and
                    skill, culminating in their triumphant victory. The final match was a spectacle of high-quality
                    cricket, with both teams demonstrating competitiveness and showcasing that they both deserved to be
                    there on top.</p>
                <p>India’s win was a fitting farewell for three of their cricketing greats—Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli,
                    and Ravindra Jadeja—who announced their retirements after the tournament. Their contributions to
                    Indian cricket have been immense, and they left behind a legacy of excellence and sportsmanship
                    inspiring the future generations. Their ability to perform under pressure and resilience was a true
                    example of warriors.The cricketing world witnessed a historic moment as India claimed victory in the
                    2024 T20 World Cup, defeating South Africa by 7 wickets in a thrilling final. The match, held at the
                    iconic Eden Gardens in Kolkata, was a spectacle of high-intensity cricket, drawing fans from across
                    the globe. This victory marked India’s second T20 World Cup title, the first since their inaugural
                    triumph in 2007.</p>
                <p>India's journey to the final was nothing short of remarkable. Entering the tournament as one of the
                    favorites, they faced stiff competition from top cricketing nations. However, India’s dominance was
                    evident throughout the tournament, as they remained unbeaten in the group stage. Their semi-final
                    clash against England was a nail-biter, with India clinching victory in the last over, thanks to the
                    heroics of Suryakumar Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah.</p>
                <p>In the final, South Africa won the toss and opted to bat first. They posted a competitive total of
                    172/6, with contributions from Quinton de Kock and Aiden Markram. However, India's bowlers, led by
                    Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav, kept the target within reach. The Indian chase was anchored by a stellar
                    partnership between captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who once again rose to the occasion in a
                    World Cup final. Kohli’s unbeaten 82 and Sharma’s composed 45 set the stage for a comfortable chase,
                    which was finished off in style by Hardik Pandya’s six in the 19th over.</p>
                <p>This win is particularly significant as it marks the end of an era for Indian cricket. The final was
                    the swansong for three modern-day legends: Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja, all of
                    whom announced their retirement from international cricket after the tournament. The trio's
                    farewell was an emotional moment, with fans and teammates paying tribute to their illustrious
                    careers.</p>

                <p>The 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup final was held at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, where India secured a
                    thrilling victory against South Africa by 7 wickets. This win marks a significant achievement for
                    Indian cricket, ending a long wait for a T20 World Cup title since their inaugural win in 2007.</p>
                <p>India’s journey through the tournament was marked by exceptional performances, both with the bat and
                    ball. Their unbeaten run in the group stage and a dramatic semi-final victory over England set the
                    stage for a memorable final.</p>
                <p>The final match showcased the depth and talent within the Indian squad. Despite South Africa posting
                    a
                    competitive total, India's strong batting lineup and disciplined bowling ensured they chased down
                    the
                    target with ease.</p>
                <p>This victory also signifies the end of an era for Indian cricket, with the retirement of key players
                    like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja, who have been instrumental in shaping Indian
                    cricket's modern success.</p>
