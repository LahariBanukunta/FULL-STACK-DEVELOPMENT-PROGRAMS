                <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field. The objective
                    is to score more runs than the opposing team. The game has various formats, including Test matches,
                    One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches.</p>
                <p>In Test cricket, matches can last up to five days, while ODIs and T20s are limited-overs formats with
                    shorter durations. The game consists of batting, bowling, and fielding, with each team taking turns
                    to bat and bowl. A batsman scores runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets or
                    hitting the ball to the boundary.</p>
                <p>Cricket has a significant cultural impact in countries like India, Australia, England, and South
                    Africa. Major tournaments include the ICC Cricket World Cup, the T20 World Cup, and various domestic
                    leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL).</p>
                <p>Iconic players in the history of cricket include Sachin Tendulkar, Sir Vivian Richards, and Shane
                    Warne. Cricket continues to grow globally, with more countries embracing the sport and developing
                    their cricketing infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>In addition to professional leagues, football is widely played at the amateur level, with millions of
                        people participating in local leagues and recreational games around the world.</p>
                   <p> In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between what were essentially club teams, from
                    the United States and Canada, in Toronto; Canada won.[46][47] In 1859, a team of English players went to
                    North America on the first overseas tour.[48] Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in
                    spreading the game overseas, and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in
                    Australia, the Caribbean, British India (which includes present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh), New
                    Zealand, North America and South Africa.[49]</p>
    
                    <p>In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia.[50] The first Australian team to travel
                    overseas consisted of Aboriginal stockmen who toured England in 1868.[51]</p>
    
                    <p></p>In 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognized as the first-ever Test
                    match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia.[52] The rivalry between England and Australia
                    gave birth to The Ashes in 1882, which remains Test cricket's most famous contest.[53] Test cricket
                    began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England.[54]</p>
